## Product Management

Product management is an organizational lifecycle function within a company dealing with the planning, forecasting, and production, or marketing of a product or products at all stages of the product lifecycle. Similarly, product lifecycle management integrates people, data, processes and business systems. It provides product information for companies and their extended supply chain enterprise.

Difference between Product Management and Project Management is, the scale and life cycle. Project Managers ensure multiple products/services/projects are delivered to a customer, while Product Managers go beyond development and work towards longjevity and operation of a product/service.

In Game development we can see the clear shift from Projects to Products due to games having more detailed post launch plans and monetization strategies.
